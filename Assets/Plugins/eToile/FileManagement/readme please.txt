Hi, first of all: thank you for purchasing File Management.
I'm sure it will make your developer's life easier.

Then: Before start with the application, please drag the "StreamingAssets" folder outside the "eToile/ExampleShared" folder.
The "StreamingAssets" folder is a special Unity fodler, you know? It must be right in the "Assets" folder, otherwise Unity will not find it.

If you see a lot of errors when opening for first time, that should be you are using the wrong platform.
So to fix it you must open your "BuildSettings" dialog and chose any pltform but "WebPlayer" (Already deprecated platform).

Please take a look at the documentation, it's short and clear.

Thanks again.
