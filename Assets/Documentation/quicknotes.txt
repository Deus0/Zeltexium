Before First build:
File system that opens/closes all files - seperate from the makers
Play through 3 levels
Portal that teleports player through levels
Enemy spawning
An npc in a house, talk to npc to get a quest
Place houses down using cut/paste voxel tools
Dialogue for first character
Chain quest to go to second level

To Fix:
Pool Chunks
Selection mesh -> Optmize this
Doesn't save models that arn't 1x1x1 chunk size
Make animations store the 9 transform values seperately instead of just the entire thing
Animator to only show selected transform
When saving model - then closing/opening game - doesnt load (just for big model)
Add Zoom in on model - in model viewer - or press f
Fixing GuiLines - LineRenderer in Guis
Save/Load Texture Blueprints
Fix Bug where play mode in level maker - doesnt hide guis

Improvements:
Streamline process of creating new tools
-> default brush icon - option for custom one
-> Add in tool functionality easier -> centralize to one place

Fixed:
Saving models in model maker
Replace Colour - with primary colour

Current:
Fix lighting in model maker - only one light source - custom layer for models
Fix Flipping
Fix build - doesnt work at first
A link function for voxelPainter - and show the bounding box of a world mesh (with some lines around the box)
a grid to paint on - when first creating a model
Can drag paint - using a xz plane for placement - either build, paint or erase modes
Selection to create a seperate model - when deselecting - place it
Selection to spawn a gizmo in the middle of the box - and can move it but it grid snaps
Orbiting camera mode
Moving blocks - erases colour values
A spread to same colours - with selection - a magic wand selection tool
when pressing selection actions - if it touches the voxel through gui it will not work - make sure raycast checking properly
New Voxel Actions:
Replace Voxel - with selected voxel

Line tool - click first point then second point - while highlighting second point will show preview of voxel lines
	- can alter xyz thickness (z is depth), - can alter maximum and minimum

After Editing Resources
Handle Resources properly - know when files are edited - what needs saving
And then quiting - You have x unsaved files, do you wish to save them?

Put in music:
Main Game Screen + Save Game
Resources Pack
Levels

Bugs:
Save game doesn't save stats
Save game doesn't save block changes
Save game doesn't save other character changes

Gui New Features:
While saving - show fade overlay screen

ToDO:
Make custom maps - 100x4x100 - well unlimited size -> and just save changes to map
Make custom maps use voxelRoam functionality
	-VoxelRoam to be part of World -> World tracks just one transform and uses it for loading
Fix SoundMaker & Nodes -> LineRenders not showing on top of Guis

Fix Dialogue - Begin talking
Fix Quests -> A dialogue section with quests to click on (similar to wow, you walk over to a character, it has a ! on its head. You click on the quests. This is used for simpler quests in the beginner town. Later on you will need to talk to npcs to unlock quests)


Custom text for Zeltex - ZeltexText to be a custom data format (off element)
TextureNodes to be its own data format - based off element - contain series of nodes/positions etc
File opener to be inside resources - will browse folders to open them - remove file lists and index thing off the makers
Can open up the indexController from a maker still - opens a little toolbar can drag around

LevelMaker:
	Edit Character Items from level - can open up a list of all the items in the dataManager -> then drag and drop them into the character inventory
	Edit textures in the map
	Same with Dialogue, Quests, Stats
	Move CharacterStats into character Component
	Edit Chest Items like this too
	Billboards to look at camera of levelmaker
	Zoom in on character button
	Follow Character button - locks camera
ToolManager - All the painters use this - setting one tool at a time - setting to tool None will restore default mouse button
	- Use animations for mouse clicks

Voxel/Art Data:
	An animation for chests to open - using skeleton system for bones
	Place Skeleton meshes into the voxel mesh -> Animations can be played - breaks it from the voxel mesh, then rebakes it after
	-> uses smart system to approximate when it should be rebaked -for now just wait an estimated time (30 secondsish)

Game Loop:
Main Menu - Resources
Then - select - go back to main menu
Zeltex Background Stays in main menu - while resouces comes out - but it gets grayed out
--------
Main Menu - have Zeltex Fade in and out
Use LevelViewer for this -> LevelMaker type implementation on viewing a voxelLevel
Have a bot fly around map
on press start - blurr out the camera of the bot
if bot dies - the camera eventually moves to a new bot
	but after 30 seconds of being on the old bot

At start - load selected Resources
Have option to change it in the main menu

-- Combat --
Cooldown indication for spells
Property system for spells - SpellProperty
Contains a name
and a list of bools - key + name
Show them in a list - the properties
Click on them to open up their bools in list
--
Big characters get stuck - they need greater block radius to walk in
Characters can't avoid other characters well - need to mark them as obstacles

Head rotates (too fast) Have it maxed angle.

Wander doesn't go up and down places - just in a random direction

They try to shoot through walls
Scaled up - the selection box wrong
Scaled up - the bounds off - doesn't jump over stuff properly
Add in commands in the level maker
Summoned beings cant be selected



Billboards to look at closest camera instead of just the main camera - Make a camera Manager for this

Only spawn character guis when needing them - instead of 10 per

Edit Character gui- from character placer:
	- Inventory gui - can drag and drop items in
	- AllItems Inventory - with scroll bar - when pick up from here, item stays in it
	- Trash Item, if drag item in here, it will disintegrate - placed on top of the AllItems Inventory Gui

Edit BotsData, save/load it in characters

Edit character quests can give - same as items

Edit character dialogues - same as items

Save files to save map changes
----
If deleted characters in level -> add those to a list of actions done
When saving level -> go through those flags -> and delete them from the level files
Can Revert these changes too -> will clear the world and reload the data
----
Polygon Painter
	-> Decouple the functions out of the viewer
	-> The polygon editor will attach itself onto a gameObject with a mesh renderer -> and Create the Vertex Handlers on this
	-> These handlers can be raycasted, whether inside a viewer or in the level editor (going to place and edit rocks in the level, as ItemHandlers)

----
Done:
Level Editor: Large
Character Placer: Character list
Cannot place more bots atm and save -> fix positioning bug
Make Bullets not hit capsule colliders - only skeletons
Make map export when i build Zeltex - Make it check various folders for resouces, including the zeltex folder

Fixed:
WOrld not set to worlds layer - same which its chunks
Turn off capsule when selected
Can't reopen model viewer (only toggles off)
When going from big to small, deletes the voxel model?
-------

notes:

use perlin noise and position of block to randomize the type of block placed down
