Zeltex Latest:
Character Creation Gui
-> if no saved character -> open that
After creating a characater, you can chose from 3 different locations
A seed is used to create a save game -> Save this seed and reuse for future generated maps
Fix GameOverScreen
Add sounds into bullets
Create a better guis to edit particular data - like bullets
 -> Select an item -> it also edits the spell linked up to the item -> also can select the texture of the item and the animation of the character
Make Save games use persistent data instead of streaming
LoadScreen to say what its loading
Loading Characters 1 out of 8
Reduce lag in combat
Automate build process to build out 4 different builds for new features

---
Make images for tutorial on how to do things:Tutorials:
    Pick Up Items
    Walk Around
    Talk To Characters
    Perform Quests
    Shoot Enemies

When dead, should just respawn another you and keep that body dead -> respawn at last check point
Checkpoints -> A glowing particle thing -> makes a sound when hitting it

-------
Scenes:
Main Game
Test SkeletonMaker (and other tools) - spawns guis
Test Combat - using plane as ground - spawns character  and has them fight each other
Test World Loading - Spawns worlds, multiple, tests designed to speed up loading
-----

Save Level chunks
Load Level chunks
Mark Edited chunks as dirty
Save Levels Characters
Load Levels Characters

Level Select Screen

Glypths for button controls
Detect if controller is connected -> switch from pc to console

Fix Textures from working in game
Import another model type and place in editor (Corner Pillar)

---------

Loading Chunks for Save Games
Chunk.HasLoaded = false for all
Then Save Game -> Has saved a chunk?
Level -> Load -> if no string, go on
Level Generation settings -> if all else fails!

-----------
Current Goal:
Save Data use persistent data
Custom Maps to be really large - Save any edited Chunks only - Use the terrain generation details as the base
The datamanager will load/unload things at runtime, but mostly at the beginning of the maps
Player can load maps in gui - from server or from local files
They first pick a map pack, then a level (tagged as begin level)
A save game will be associated with a mappack, if they begin on a certain level

-------------
Top Priority:
Save Games
Revive of characters
Pause Menu Update
Status Screen to replace others (for useability)
Smaller Rats to spawn inside the tunnels -> and just move around in a fixed radius
Create human body, arms and legs
Animate them inside editor -> Add keyframes -> Adjust Time
Animate the disspearing of the healthbar once they take damage
A level portal and second level
Procedural Music System
Music for game
Music for Menu

Bug Fixes:Bots to not work after they die

---------------

Zeltex Goals:Multiplayer game loop working
Multiplayer lobbies
Multiplayer Default Resources
Multiplayer Download Resources gui

New Pause Gui
New Lobby Selection
New Pre Game Gui

--------------

Done:
Save Game
Load Save games
When loading: load the level chunks from save games first, then level data
Remove Menu and replace with just a pause screen
Loading Screen when loading new level
Capsule Collider is wrong size for MC
Skillbar not refreshed when spawned
Press 'I' to open inventory - and can place items in it
Fix item clicking, and dragging, dropping

Guis not set properly - started as disabled
Loading New One - doesn't spawn character properly
Doesn't save colours of map properly atm - check this
Save the characters in the level
IsPlayer is not set properly for mc
Load Characters in level

Import Vox As a level
Bake Audio Notes into a list -> and play them at random each time
Push and pull skeletons
Save Level - Chunks
Make Control for cursor

Character saves - to reference skeletons, etc
Decouple Data from MakerGuis
Update Makers when data is uploaded -> create an event on datamanagers, when loaded a type of data, activate thus event (add to datafolder)
Then fix custom maps

fine:
Fixing push pull of skeletons
-> rip to work on meshes
-> activate to work on meshes
-> Load voxel model in editor onto a world script
Duplicate a bot -> Make its normal movement idle
Fix Skillbar Item Textures
Give bot dialogue
Upon press e -> open dialogue gui
Fix Choices
Give Quest on choice
-> Tooltip - press e to talk
----------------

Level Select Screen -> used if admin -> can  start playing from any level once selected -> Displays level in a grid

Game Begins on Countdown, after 3 seconds, it will count down for 5 seconds before game begins

Toast on Game Begin
Toast Icon for new Quest Accepted

GameOver - Upon death, display gameover, give COntinue/NewGame options
If die, revert all the npc positions/stats etc, as well as any changed chunks - rewind mode
Checkpoints -> Upon reaching a save point, it will save current status (in save games) of game -> It's a weird voxel model that animates when you click it -> Like zelda game

Portal -> Teleports player to a new level or old one -> once teleported someone it will disable for 15 seconds

Misc:
Wall Placer
Edit Transform thing - Select either VoxelModel, Skeleton bone, polygon helper thing, character in map, zone, voxel placer (a group of voxels that have yet to be placed)
Edit Level - Edit the game rules - Add timed events - ie spawn x unit at location
Limit character units , say 100
if Characters count goes over 32, cull their meshes to half subdivision (make the thing for this)
if over 64 half again
limit of 128 per map
Cube Placement, and erasing, like magic voxel
First area pass: 3 enemy spawn zones
Biome map - paint over it too - determines where enemies spawn
